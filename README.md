Wizard of Oz Solutions has received a request for a tool that will allow users to easily determine the nth value in the Fibonacci sequence.

The Fibonacci series was named after the Italian mathematician Fibonacci. In a Fibonacci series, any number at position N is defined as the sum of numbers at positions (N-1) and (N-2).
The first 10 terms of the Fibonacci series are:

 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

The program main should prompt the user for which position in the series to calculate, call a function to calculate the value at that position and output the value to the user. 

The client specifically requested that a recursive function be utilized to calculate the Fibonacci value.  The function definition should resemble:

def daFib(n):

The user should be allowed to calculate the area as many times as they wish, with the program providing the option to calculate another number in the series or to exit the program.
